# Linked List Programs

This repository contains two C++ programs that implement single and double linked lists. Linked lists are fundamental data structures used in computer science for dynamic storage and efficient insertion and deletion of data elements. Below are brief descriptions and usage instructions for both programs.

## Single Linked List

### Program Description
The single linked list program (`linked_list.cpp`) provides a basic implementation of a singly linked list. It allows you to perform the following operations:
- Insertion of elements at the beginning of the list.
- Deletion of elements from the beginning of the list.
- Searching for elements in the list.

### Usage
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. You can choose from the following options:
   - Insertion: Add elements to the linked list.
   - Deletion: Remove elements from the beginning of the list.
   - Searching: Search for a specific element in the list.
   - Exit: Terminate the program.

The program will display the linked list after each operation, allowing you to observe the changes.

## Double Linked List

### Program Description
The double linked list program (`double_linked_list.cpp`) provides a basic implementation of a doubly linked list. It offers similar operations to the single linked list, such as:
- Insertion of elements at the beginning of the list.
- Deletion of elements from the beginning of the list.
- Searching for elements in the list.

### Usage
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. You can choose from the following options:
   - Insertion: Add elements to the linked list.
   - Deletion: Remove elements from the beginning of the list.
   - Searching: Search for a specific element in the list.
   - Exit: Terminate the program.

The program will display the doubly linked list after each operation, allowing you to see the changes.

## Getting Started
To use these programs, make sure you have a C++ development environment installed on your system. You can compile and run the programs within your chosen development environment or through the command line.

### Example Compilation (Command Line)
```bash
g++ linked_list.cpp -o single_linked_list
g++ double_linked_list.cpp -o double_linked_list
```

### Example Execution (Command Line)
```bash
./single_linked_list
./double_linked_list
```

Feel free to explore and experiment with these linked list implementations to understand the basics of linked list data structures and operations.
