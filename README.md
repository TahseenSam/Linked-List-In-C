# Linked List Operations README

This is a C++ program that implements a simple linked list with basic operations like insertion, deletion, and searching. The program provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with the linked list.

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure that you have:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++) installed on your system.
- A basic understanding of C++ programming.

## Program Overview

This C++ program implements a singly linked list using a class called `linked_list`. The program provides a menu-driven interface for the following operations:

1. **Insertion:** Add elements to the linked list.
2. **Deletion:** Remove the first element from the linked list.
3. **Searching:** Search for a specific element in the linked list.
4. **Exit:** Terminate the program.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ linked_list.cpp -o linked_list_program
   ```

2. Run the program:

   ```bash
   ./linked_list_program
   ```

3. Follow the menu options to perform various linked list operations.

## Available Operations

The program provides the following operations in a menu:

1. **Insertion:** Allows you to add elements to the linked list. You can add multiple elements one by one and then choose to continue or exit the insertion process.

2. **Deletion:** Removes the first element from the linked list. If the list is empty, it displays a message.

3. **Searching:** Allows you to search for a specific element in the linked list. It will inform you if the element is found or not. If the list is empty, it displays a message.

4. **Exit:** Exits the program.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of the following components:

- A `node` structure representing a single node in the linked list, which contains an integer data element and a pointer to the next node.

- A `linked_list` class that includes member functions for insertion, deletion, and searching, as well as a constructor to initialize the head and tail pointers.

- The `main` function that provides the menu interface for users to interact with the linked list. It uses a loop to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.
